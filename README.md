## ‚ö†Ô∏è Move Game Save Data to Ajay Prefix

If you were playing games before installing Ajay Prefix, you need to manually move your game save data from:

`C:\Users\...`

to:

`selected drive:\Ajay_prefix\save_data\users\...`

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Synchronization of Ajay Prefix Save Data Across Different Containers or Emulators

To keep your save data in sync, make sure that the `selected drive:` location is set to the same folder across all containers or emulators.  
If that's not possible, you'll need to manually copy the save data between them.

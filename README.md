## ‚ú® Tricky installation

Some Emu may prevent changes in system.reg and user.reg like winlator bionic container etc , It install fine on normal container.

Here are some methods to install Ajay prefix registry in current container.

### For Winlator bionic container

- Download home.zip from [here](https://github.com/ajay9634/Ajay-prefix/raw/refs/heads/Pre-installed-Ajay-prefix/Files/Winlator-bionic/home.7z) , Extract it then copy home folder to drive Z by wfm , Restart the bionic container then check ajay prefix status. Now you can install Ajay Prefix start menu.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Move game save data to Ajay prefix

If you were playing games before installing the Ajay prefix then you need to move game save from drive C/users/... to drive D/Ajay_prefix/save_data/users/...

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Synchronisation of Ajay prefix save data in different Container or Emulator

You need to set drive D location in the same folder otherwise copy save data manually.

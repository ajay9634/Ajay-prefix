Now you can install Ajay Prefix start menu.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Move game save data to Ajay prefix

If you were playing games before installing the Ajay prefix then you need to move game save from drive C/users/... to drive D/Ajay_prefix/save_data/users/...

# ‚ö†Ô∏è Synchronisation of Ajay prefix save data in different Container or Emulator

You need to set drive D location in the same folder otherwise copy save data manually.

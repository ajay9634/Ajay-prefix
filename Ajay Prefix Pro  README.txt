# Ajay Prefix Pro v1.0 - README

## Overview
This application, **Ajay Prefix Pro v1.0**, is a self-extracting archive (SFX) built using WinRAR. It is designed to redirect user registry paths (e.g., Documents folder) on Windows systems, utilizing a 64-bit command-line environment for proper configuration. The tool includes custom scripts to manage this process efficiently.

## VirusTotal Flags
If you encounter flags on VirusTotal (https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/1d79957eb4f19d710788a7aa9400b45c62f2b65af8c56b78a5278db891e91cbb?nocache=1), please note the following:
- These flags are **false positives**, primarily triggered because the scripts execute from a temporary directory (`C:\Windows\Temp`) due to the SFX extraction process.
- The application has been tested on a Windows PC, and no malicious activity ( The intended registry redirection functioned as expected.
- Specific flags (e.g., "DarkGate AutoIt3.EXE Execution Parameters," "Suspicious Script Execution From Temp Folder") are likely due to sandbox misinterpretation of the SFX stub or WScript usage for user feedback.


## Reviewing the Scripts
To ensure transparency, all scripts within this SFX are accessible for review or verification. Follow these steps:

1. **Install WinRAR**: Ensure WinRAR is installed on your Windows PC or Wine environment.
2. **Open the Archive**: Right-click `AjayPrefixPro_v1.0.exe` and select "Open with WinRAR" (or extract using WinRAR).
3. **Extract and Review**: Use the password `-q` to access the archive contents. Open the scripts (e.g., `Run.au3`, `Setup.ajau3`, `Setup_main.bat`) with Notepad or any text editor to inspect the code.
   - **Run.au3**: Manages 64-bit cmd.exe execution for registry updates.
   - **Setup.ajau3**: Provides a GUI for folder selection, saving paths to a configuration file.
   - **Setup_main.bat**: Orchestrates the setup, including registry modifications and backups.

## Usage Instructions
- **Extraction**: The SFX automatically extracts to `C:\Windows\Temp` and runs `Setup_main.bat`. For manual control, extract to a preferred directory (e.g., `C:\Program Files\Ajay_Scripts`) and run `Setup_main.bat` with administrator privileges.
- **Requirements**: Admin rights are needed for registry changes. Ensure AutoIt is installed if running `.au3` files directly.
- **Note**: Some antivirus software may flag the SFX due to its design. This is a false positiveâ€”proceed if you trust the source.
